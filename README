We had many different strategies for testing. The first thing we needed to test was the server itself, 
to make sure it was binding correctly and that the socket was being opened. We then had to check if the
server was able to connect correctly to a client or netcat. The actual coding part with the string literal
from the client was done in separate parts. We made sure the 3 letter command was working before moving on
to scan the length of the rest of the string literal. Once these two things were done we had to properly
incorporate the GET, SET and DEL commands and when we finished and we got all these things to work we knew 
that our program was working. We finally worked on incorporating the threads at the end, and once it was working
for multiple connections we realized it was working with multiple threads.
